# Memory Bank Optimization and Archiving System: Combined Plan

## Introduction

### Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing a memory bank optimization and archiving system that will help streamline Roo by selectively archiving items that are complete or no longer necessary for loading into context, ultimately saving token costs. The system introduces a structured approach to memory management with tagging, archiving criteria, and retrieval mechanisms that work together to maintain an efficient memory footprint while preserving historical information.

### Learning Objectives/Expected Outcomes

* Understand the architecture and components of the memory bank optimization system
* Learn how the tagging system works to identify archivable content
* Master the file-specific archiving criteria for different memory bank files
* Be able to implement the archiving process during UMB operations
* Gain knowledge of the search and retrieval mechanisms for archived content
* Learn how to use the PowerShell integration scripts for new and existing projects
* Understand how the system reduces token costs through selective loading

## 4. Tagging System

We'll implement a consistent tagging system across all memory bank files:

*   `<!-- @active -->` - Currently relevant items
*   `<!-- @completed -->` - Items that have been completed but might still be relevant
*   `<!-- @obsolete -->` - Items that are no longer relevant
*   `<!-- @archived -->` - Items that have been moved to archive files
*   `<!-- @project:ProjectName -->` - Project association

Example:

```markdown
<!-- @active -->
[2025-03-20 14:30:00] - Working on feature X implementation
<!-- @end -->

<!-- @project:ProjectName -->
[2025-03-15 10:15:00] - Decision to use React for the frontend
<!-- @end -->

<!-- @completed -->
[2025-03-10 09:00:00] - Completed initial setup of project structure
<!-- @end -->
```

## 5. File-Specific Archiving Criteria

### 5.1 activeContext.md

*   **Archivable when**:
    *   Open questions/issues marked as `#completed` or `#obsolete`
    *   Recent changes older than 30 days and not referenced in recent tasks
    *   Current focus items that have been superseded by newer focus areas

### 5.2 decisionLog.md

*   **Archivable when**:
    *   Decisions that have been superseded by newer decisions (marked `#obsolete`)
    *   Decisions related to completed features/components (marked `#completed`)
    *   Decisions older than 60 days that don't impact current development

### 5.3 progress.md

*   **Archivable when**:
    *   Completed milestones/tasks (marked `#completed`)
    *   Progress entries older than 30 days
    *   Entries related to features/components that are no longer being actively developed

## 6. Archiving Process

### 6.1 Automatic Check During UMB

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Roo: UMB Command
    Roo->>Memory Bank: Read files
    Roo->>Roo: Process UMB updates
    Roo->>Roo: Check for archivable items
    alt Items found
        Roo->>User: Suggest items for archiving
        User->>Roo: Confirm/Decline
        alt User confirms
            Roo->>Archives: Move items
            Roo->>Memory Bank: Update files
            Roo->>Archive Index: Update index
        end
    end
    Roo->>User: Complete UMB process
```

### 6.2 Archive File Format

Each archive file will maintain the same structure as its source file, with additional metadata:

*   Original file source
*   Date archived
*   Reason for archiving
*   Tags

### 6.3 Archive Index

The `archive-index.md` file will serve as a searchable index of all archived items, containing:

*   Brief description of each archived item
*   Original file source
*   Date archived
*   Keywords for searching
*   Link to the specific section in the archive file

## 7. Memory Configuration File (memory-config.json)

```json
{
  "activeProjects": ["ProjectA", "ProjectB"],
  "completedProjects": ["ProjectC"],
  "archiveSettings": {
    "autoArchiveCompleted": true,
    "keepCompletedDays": 14,
    "archiveOnUMB": true
  },
  "loadSettings": {
    "prioritizeActive": true,
    "maxEntriesPerFile": 50,
    "loadCompletedProjects": false
  },
  "projectMetadata": {
    "ProjectA": {
      "status": "active",
      "lastActivity": "2025-03-25T14:30:00Z"
    },
    "ProjectB": {
      "status": "active",
      "lastActivity": "2025-03-24T10:15:00Z"
    },
    "ProjectC": {
      "status": "completed",
      "completionDate": "2025-03-10T09:00:00Z",
      "archived": true,
      "archivePath": "memory-archives/ProjectC/"
    }
  }
}
```

## 8. Memory Manager Commands

1.  **Archive Project**: Move completed project information to archives

    ```
    Archive Project [ProjectName]
    ```
2.  **Mark Project Complete**: Tag a project as completed (ready for archiving)

    ```
    Mark Project Complete [ProjectName]
    ```
3.  **Mark Project Active**: Change a project's status to active

    ```
    Mark Project Active [ProjectName]
    ```
4.  **Retrieve Archive**: Load archived information for a specific project

    ```
    Retrieve Archive [ProjectName]
    ```
5.  **Optimize Memory Bank**: Clean up and optimize the current memory bank

    ```
    Optimize Memory Bank
    ```

## 9. Memory Bank Loading Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start Task] --> B{Memory Bank Exists?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Read memory-config.json]
    B -->|No| D[Initialize Memory Bank]

    C --> E{Active Projects?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Load Active Project Entries]
    E -->|No| G[Load Default Entries]

    F --> H{Load Settings}
    H --> I[Apply Entry Limits]
    H --> J[Prioritize Recent/Tagged]

    I --> K[Set Memory Bank Status]
    J --> K

    K --> L[Proceed with Task]

    M[User Command: Retrieve Archive] --> N[Load Specific Archive]
    N --> O[Temporarily Add to Context]
    O --> L
```

## 10. Search and Retrieval

### 10.1 Search Command

Implement a new "Search Archives" (SA) command that allows users to:

*   Search by keywords
*   Filter by original file type
*   Filter by date range
*   Filter by tags

### 10.2 Retrieval Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Roo: SA Command with query
    Roo->>Archive Index: Search for matches
    Archive Index->>Roo: Return matches
    Roo->>User: Display results
    User->>Roo: Select item to retrieve
    Roo->>Archives: Fetch item
    Roo->>User: Display full item
    opt Restore Item
        User->>Roo: Request to restore
        Roo->>Memory Bank: Copy item back
        Roo->>Archives: Update status
        Roo->>User: Confirm restoration
    end
```

## 11. PowerShell Integration Scripts

### 11.1 `Initialize-RooMemorySystem.ps1`

*   **Purpose**: Sets up the memory bank optimization and archiving system in a **new** project directory.
*   **Actions**:
    *   Creates the `memory-bank/archives/` directory.
    *   Creates the `memory-archives/` directory.
    *   Creates the `memory-config.json` file with default settings.
    *   Initializes empty archive files (`activeContext-archive.md`, etc.) within `memory-bank/archives/`.
    *   Initializes an empty `archive-index.md`.
    *   Optionally copies the `memory-manager.ps1` script (if it's a standalone tool).
*   **Usage**: `.\scripts\Initialize-RooMemorySystem.ps1 -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\new\project"`

### 11.2 `Apply-RooMemorySystemToExisting.ps1`

*   **Purpose**: Applies the memory bank optimization and archiving system to an **existing** project with a potentially populated memory bank.
*   **Actions**:
    *   Checks for and creates `memory-bank/archives/` and `memory-archives/` if they don't exist.
    *   Checks for and creates `memory-config.json` with default settings if it doesn't exist.
    *   Checks for and creates empty archive files and `archive-index.md` if they don't exist.
    *   **Integrates with Migration Tools**:
        *   Runs an analysis of the existing memory bank files (similar to `Migrate Memory Bank --analyze-only`).
        *   Prompts the user to confirm the proposed project structure and tagging (similar to `Migrate Memory Bank --interactive`).
        *   Applies retroactive tagging to existing entries based on user confirmation.
        *   Optionally moves identified "completed" or "obsolete" items to the archive based on initial analysis and user confirmation.
*   **Usage**: `.\scripts\Apply-RooMemorySystemToExisting.ps1 -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\existing\project"`

## 12. Implementation Steps

1.  **Create Core Directory Structure & Files**
    *   Define the structure (`memory-bank/archives/`, `memory-archives/`).
    *   Define the format for `memory-config.json`, archive files, and `archive-index.md`.
2.  **Develop PowerShell Integration Scripts**
    *   Create `Initialize-RooMemorySystem.ps1`.
    *   Create `Apply-RooMemorySystemToExisting.ps1` (initial version focusing on structure setup).
3.  **Update Memory Bank File Format & Tagging**
    *   Modify existing files/processes to support tagging (`<!-- @tag -->`).
    *   Update documentation for the tagging system.
4.  **Implement Archiving Logic**
    *   Develop file-specific criteria evaluation logic.
    *   Create the archiving suggestion mechanism (during UMB).
    *   Implement the user confirmation workflow.
    *   Build the functionality to move items to archive files and update the index.
5.  **Enhance UMB Command**
    *   Integrate the archiving check and suggestion flow into the UMB process.
6.  **Create Search Functionality**
    *   Implement the "Search Archives" (SA) command.
    *   Develop search algorithms (index-based).
    *   Create result display and item retrieval/restore mechanisms.
7.  **Implement Memory Manager Script/Tool**
    *   Create the `memory-manager.ps1` (or integrate commands elsewhere).
    *   Implement commands: `Archive Project`, `Mark Project Complete/Active`, `Retrieve Archive`, `Optimize Memory Bank`.
8.  **Update Loading Process**
    *   Modify memory bank initialization to read `memory-config.json` and perform selective loading based on settings.
    *   Implement the `Retrieve Archive` command's effect on the loading process.
9.  **Build Migration Tools & Enhance `Apply-RooMemorySystemToExisting.ps1`**
    *   Build the analysis tool for existing memory banks.
    *   Create the retroactive tagging system (interactive).
    *   Implement the core migration logic (`Migrate Memory Bank` command functionality).
    *   Integrate these tools fully into `Apply-RooMemorySystemToExisting.ps1`.
10. **Update Documentation**
    *   Document the full system, including PowerShell scripts and migration.
    *   Create user guides.
11. **Custom Mode Updates**
    *   Update mode definitions for awareness and interaction with the new system.
12. **Testing Plan**
    *   **Unit Testing**: Test tagging, criteria, archiving logic, script actions.
    *   **Integration Testing**: Test UMB flow, SA command, Memory Manager commands, loading process, full script runs (new and existing projects).
    *   **User Acceptance Testing**: Test with real project data, verify suggestions, confirm search accuracy, test migration on diverse projects.

## 13. Saving Token Cost

*   By implementing selective loading, only the most relevant information will be loaded into the context, reducing token consumption.
*   By archiving obsolete or completed items, the size of the active memory bank will be reduced, further reducing token consumption.
*   By implementing a tiered search system, users can start with a default search that only searches the active memory bank, and then expand the search to include archives if necessary. This will help to minimize token consumption for most searches.
